## Projects
### Digit Recogniser from scratch
[Link](https://github.com/AbhipshaDash/NN_from_scratch)

In this project, a simple two-layer neural network was developed from scratch to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The implementation did not utilize any high-level machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow or Keras. Instead, the network architecture and training algorithms were coded manually, allowing for a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanics of neural networks. The network was trained on the MNIST dataset, achieving a training accuracy of 85% and a testing accuracy of 84%. This project demonstrates fundamental concepts in neural network design and training, including forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent.

### Image Generation Using GANs on the MNIST dataset
[Link](https://github.com/AbhipshaDash/Image_Generation_Using_GANs)

This project involves the implementation of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate handwritten digit images similar to those in the MNIST dataset. GANs are a powerful type of neural network architecture used for generative modeling, where the goal is to generate new data instances that resemble the training data. The project demonstrates how to build and train the process of building, training, and evaluating GANs, emphasizing their ability to create realistic data samples. 


### PM 2.5 Level Prediction Using Weather Data
[Link](https://github.com/AbhipshaDash/D3_Fest_Web_app)

This project involved predicting PM 2.5 levels using historical weather data through a machine learning model deployed on Streamlit. The model, processes inputs such as temperature, pressure, rainfall, wind direction, and wind speed to provide accurate predictions of PM 2.5 levels. Users can interact with the Streamlit application to input weather parameters and instantly receive predictions, aiding in real-time air quality monitoring and decision-making. This work secured third place in the D^3 Hackathon, demonstrating its effectiveness and innovation in environmental monitoring.

### Heart Disease Prediction 
[Link](https://github.com/AbhipshaDash/Disease_Prediction)

This project implements a simple disease prediction system using Logistic Regression. The heart disease dataset is loaded from a CSV file, explored for insights, and preprocessed by separating features and the target variable. The data is then split into training and test sets. A Logistic Regression model is trained on the training set, evaluated on both training and test sets, and used to make predictions about heart disease presence based on given medical attributes.
